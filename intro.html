  <p class="left">Washington D.C. is the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United States.</p>

  <p class="left">Since the 1970s, the <strong>urban sprawl</strong> -- the physical expansion of residential housing -- around D.C. has increased dramatically.</p>

  <p class="left">This has resulted in a large amount of areas with low population density covering large swathes of Maryland.</p>
  <p class="left">While this may seem like a natural, inevitable part of population growth, it has brought with it a host of issues that directly hurt the economic, environmental, physical and mental wellbeing of the residents. The purpose of this site is to give an overview of some of the major issues that urban sprawl causes, and hopefully give some ideas for solutions that let D.C. grow while keeping its residents happy and healthy.</p>
