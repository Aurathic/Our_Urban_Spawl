    <p class="left">One of the allures of building new infrastructure for local governments is that it's relatively cheap to start, as they are subsidized by state or federal governments [Source?], and it lets the city grow. However, the local goverments now need to pay for the maintainence of that infrastructure, and the cost of that upkeep universally outweighs the financial return from growth in the long term.</p>

    <p class="left">Fundamentally, the solvency of a place is determined by the difference between its profits and its revenues. But as houses are spread out further and further, that means that per unit of land, there are fewer people or businesses that you can tax -- but the cost of infrastructure (like roads and pipes) stays the same. In addition, if everyone needs to use a car, then each building needs to reserve a large amount of space for parking, decreasing the taxable entities per unit of land even more.</p>

    <p class="left">This means that many places rely on <em>exponential growth</em> in order to stay alive -- as new people settle into the area, the local government's tax revenue rises, so they can afford to continue expanding [TODO explain better]</p>
