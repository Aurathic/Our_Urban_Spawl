    <p class="left">Because of how spread out everything in the suburbs are, children under 16 are entirely dependent on other transportation to get to school, and because of the lack of public transportation [TODO: Provide source for this], must rely on their parents in order to get to jobs, friends' houses, or any other place besides their school.</p>
    <p class="left">For example, in order to get from Travilah (a very average Maryland suburb) to Travilah Elementary School, it takes just 6 minutes by car...</p>

    <p class="left">...but nearly an hour if you were crazy enough to walk.</p>

    <p class="left">Furthermore, this walk would require you to walk on a narrow strip of grass on the side of the road for the entire time -- there are no sidewalks here. (But this is still better than many other pedestrian commutes, where walkers have to navigate wide dangerous streets which are inhospitable to those outside of a car.)</p>
    <p class="left">A <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41514991?seq=4>1995 study</a> found that children from families who couldn't leave their house without an adult had less than half as many playmates in their neighborhood as children who could, and the play of by latter group of children was more spontaneous and imaginative than that of the former.</p>
    <p class="left">A lack of independent mobility is associated with issues like deficits in motor skills and even issues with cognitive spatial ability <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X18301121#b0020">(Source)</a>. [TODO Elaborate why]</p>

    <h2 class="left">Work Commutes</h2>
    <p class="left">Since the urban sprawl is focused around D.C., a large portion of the people living in these areas have jobs in D.C. which require very long commutes. D.C.-area workers have among the longest commutes in the country -- an average of 47 minutes, compared to the national average of 27 minutes <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/01/24/d-c-has-some-of-the-longest-commutes-in-the-country-what-help-is-available/">(Source)</a>.</p>

    <p class="left">And the length of commute matters <em>a lot</em> to happiness of commuters. </p>

    <p class="left"> Of course, people don't deliberately seek out longer commutes -- they're forced into them by the fact that all available housing (at prices they can afford) is far away from the places that most people work. (But we'll talk more about that in the final section.) </p>

    <p class="left">The fact that many Americans have to drive instead of walking or biking also contributes to obesity in the </p>
