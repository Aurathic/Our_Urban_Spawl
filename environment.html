  <h2 class="left">Greenhouse Gases</h2>
  <p class="left">As climate change is currently disrupting global ecosystems and destroying the lives of people around the world, we need to take steps to limit our environmental impact. And the US has a lot of room for improvement, having among the largest per-person carbon emissions -- a rate which is high even among other developed nations.</p>

  <p class="left">Part of the reason for this is because of urban sprawl. For example, the plurality of greenhouse gas emissions in the US come from transportation, and more than half of transportation costs are due to "light-duty" vehicles -- in other words, passenger cars. </p>

  <p class="left">This is, in large part, because of the structure of surburban communities requiring Americans to drive to get to nearly any thing of interest -- a topic which will be explored later.</p>
  <p class="left">In addition, almost all urban sprawl housing is single-family detached housing -- in other words, there's one family per house, and the houses are not connected to each other like townhouses. This dramatically increases heating costs for each household, since detached housing means more surface area is exposed to the outside, so there is more opportunity for energy to escape. According to a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-03/documents/location_efficiency_btu.pdf">2014 report from the EPA</a>, "Most residential energy use goes to space heating" and "The data show that an average multifamily unit uses half the energy of a single family detached home."</p>

  <p class="left">For these reasons, surprisingly, households in the areas <em>around</em> cities have much higher footprints than those within cities.</p>

  <p class="left">Urban sprawl also requires the destruction of large natural areas with local wildlife and fragile ecological communities. [TODO]</p>
