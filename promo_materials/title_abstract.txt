Our Urban Sprawl: Showing The Issues of Suburban Design

American cities and suburbs have a major design problem. An overdependence on cars has led to an unhappy populace, bankrupt cities, and encroaching climate catastrophe. While many support changes to U.S. public transit, there are both entrenched regulations (such as single-family zoning) and “common-sense” cultural attitudes that lead to car-focused instead of human-focused design. This project intends to educate and convince ordinary citizens of the issues with modern (sub)urban planning and give them the tools to enact change in their communities, accomplished through a (visually pleasing) website which displays hard evidence for the claims in a manner readable to laymen, as well as employing rhetorical techniques and calls to action to convince the reader.
